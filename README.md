Submitted by: **Lisa Fabien**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
* [x] Changed the background and font for a more aesthetic presentation.
* [x] Created an app icon using Figma and icons8 for a more aesthetic presentation.

## Notes

I started the project with SwiftUI as the user interface and was very confused so I took a break. In the morning I re-read the instructions and was able to change the
user interface to Storyboard. The 'teams' warning I received was confusing, but was able to use the Walkthrough video as a guide. For a while my keyboard wasn't 
showing up and it was distressing, but after many tries I was able to see what the problem was.
